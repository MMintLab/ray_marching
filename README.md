# Ray Marching SDF

Algorithm to do ray marching for reconstruction of SDFs. Draws heavily from the following resources:

* [Jamie Wong's excellent tutorial](http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/)
* [Excellent tutorial from Electric Square](https://github.com/electricsquare/raymarching-workshop)
* [Ingo Quilez's cool SDF work](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm)
* [Michael Walczyk's guide to ray marching](https://michaelwalczyk.com/blog-ray-marching.html)
* [Interesting class-based implementation by James Bowman](https://github.com/jamesbowman/raytrace/blob/master/rt3.py)
